# Deprecated Anhydrite

### ðŸš¨ Attention ðŸš¨
**This version of the Anhydrite token is obsolete and is no longer supported or used by us.**

ðŸ‘‰ We strongly recommend using the latest release available in the [updated repository](https://github.com/Anhydr1te/AnhydriteGamingEcosystem). Please follow the link to access the most current version and additional information.

Even though this old version of the Anhydrite token is not in use by our team, it has been deployed on the blockchain and remains fully functional. You can view its status on the blockchain at [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/token/0x578b350455932aC3d0e7ce5d7fa62d7785872221).

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
